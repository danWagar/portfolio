# My Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio

Live at: https://dandwagar.com

A very large emphasis was placed on design.  I would like my portfolio itself to speak for the skills I am able to provide, and not just a website to show off my skills through other projects, so I took time to add a lot of extra touches like animated menus or a one-off canvas animation for my landing page.
