Approximately 80-100 hours were spent on the developent of this portfolio during the three weeks between my Thinkful initial interview and the Thinkful EI course start date.

A very large emphasis was placed on design.  I would like my portfolio itself to speak for the skills I am able to provide, and not just a website to show off my skills through other projects, so I took time to add a lot of extra touches like animated menus or a one-off canvas animation for my landing page.  

The skills section is currently under development and is only styled properly for viewing on mobile devices.
